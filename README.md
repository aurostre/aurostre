Hi! I'm @aurostre, but you can call me Ashe.

I currently work for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. Most of my projects take the form of scripting (**PowerShell**, **Bash**, etc...). I specialize in **automation**, **security**, and **system administration**.

I am primarily working with my existing team, but I am open to collaborating on open-source projects that benefit all technologists and users.

Thanks for reading!
